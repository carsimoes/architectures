Best for:

High-volume data like click streams and user logs

Low-value data that can be lost occasionally without big consequencesâ€”in other words, not bank transactions

Social networks


Caveats:

Transactional support is more difficult with RAM databases.

Generating enough load to test the system can be challenging, but the individual nodes can be tested independently.

Developing the expertise to cache the data for speed without corrupting multiple copies is difficult.
