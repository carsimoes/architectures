Best for:

Websites with small components

Corporate data centers with well-defined boundaries

Rapidly developing new businesses and web applications

Development teams that are spread out, often across the globe



Caveats:

The services must be largely independent or else interaction can cause the cloud to become imbalanced.

Not all applications have tasks that canâ€™t be easily split into independent units.

Performance can suffer when tasks are spread out between different microservices. The communication costs can be significant.

Too many microservices can confuse users as parts of the web page appear much later than others.
